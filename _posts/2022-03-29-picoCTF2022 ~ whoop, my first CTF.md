It’s been a fun ride joining [picoCTF2022](https://play.picoctf.org/events/70). I found John Hammond shared on LinkedIn about it, encouraging that it’s beginner-friendly. And I jumped right into it, registered, and waited for the challenge to start.

There are 5 main categories: ***Web Exploitation, Cryptography, Forensics, Binary Exploitation, and Reverse Engineering.*** Each challenge has points ranging from 100 to 500, depending on its difficulty level. My strength, as of now, is `Web Exploitation,` so I decided to cover it first.

There are 12 challenges for Web Exploitation category, covering XSS, SQLi, Broken Access, and so on. Below is write-ups for each challenge.
