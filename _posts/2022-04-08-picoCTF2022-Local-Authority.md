There is a login form on the website. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs in the source üîç

![Untitled](/assets/posts/2022-03-29-picoCTF2022%20~%20whoop%2C%20my%20first%20CTF%20%F0%9F%9A%80/2022-04-08-picoCTF2022-Local-Authority/Untitled.png)

Nothing much on the page really. No `.js` file as well. The form is sending a `POST` request to `/login.php` Let‚Äôs try logging in!

<aside>
ü§´ Psst¬†remember to open DevTools, so you can look at the `Network` tab and see what‚Äôs in a request.

You won‚Äôt be successfully log in, BUT you see what sources come with the request?

Double check with the `login.php` source, the `secure.js` and `style.css` are included. Let‚Äôs look at those files, shall we?

Nothing in css file. In `secure.js`, turns out, it‚Äôs not that secured at all. It‚Äôs hard-coded checking credentials.

Once you get those credentials, go back and log in again. The flag shall be revealed üö© 

## Closing Thoughts üí°

This is not a wise practice to authenticate the website on the client and hard-coded checking reveals credentials to the public. Typically, there would be a database to store users‚Äô credentials. All passwords should be hashed (one-way function, not supposed to be reversible.) One popular algorithm used for this purpose is hashing with salt or so-called `salted-hash.` Salt is made of a unique random string added to an input of hashing function, which is a password in this case. It then results in a unique hash for each input even if inputs are the same.

If you want to go deeper on the salted hash, Auth0 has [an article](https://auth0.com/blog/adding-salt-to-hashing-a-better-way-to-store-passwords/) explaining the salted hash quite well.
