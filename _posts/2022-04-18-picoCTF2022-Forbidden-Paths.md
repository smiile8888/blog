This is a classic problem of file inclusion. If you want to learn more ***what the file inclusion is?*** ü§î¬†Check out [my local file inclusion writeup.](/THM-File-Inclusion) I explain it in details and link with informative resources for you to dive deeper.

Come back to the problem. First thing first, let‚Äôs go the website.

There is nothing really, excepts the input box that we can do something with. From the description, it says *‚Äúthe website is filtering absolute file paths‚Äù.* Should we try if that is true?

Yepper, it show back `Not Authorized`.

So what else can we do to access files? A relative path it is.

**What is a relative path?**

<aside>
üí° A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current working directory. It uses `.`, a dot, to refer a current working directory, and `..`, or a double dot, to refer a parent directory.

</aside>

How can we get the relative path of `/flag.txt`?

Instead of entering `/flag.txt`, we can enter `../../../../flag.txt`.

And there we go üö©

### ‚úçÔ∏è¬†Note:

when it comes to a relative path, you can do `../` as many as levels of directory or more. In this case, you can do `../../../../../../../flag.txt`; that will still bring you to `/`.
