I was wandering around Buffer Overflow in the past few days and found out interesting rooms on TryHackMe about the `sudo` vulnerabilities back in late 2019 and the beginning of 2020—*CVE-2019-14287, CVE-2019-18634*. Both were reported by Joe Vennix.

The first one, *CVE-2019-14287,* is the sudo bypass when using `sudo -u#<ID> command`  and if you specify `ID` to be `-1` or its unsigned equivalent to `4294967295`, `sudo` would read it as `0` , a.k.a., `root` .  The proof of concept can be found here, [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502). If you are curious to see in action, check out THM room here, [https://tryhackme.com/room/sudovulnsbypass](https://tryhackme.com/room/sudovulnsbypass). It happens with versions prior to `1.8.28`.

The second one, *CVE-2019-18634,* is the buffer overflow vulnerability when using `sudo` and overflow the password to gain root access. This happens because `pwfeedback` is enabled in `/etc/sudoers`. It’s normally turned off, but in ElementaryOS and Linux Mint are not the case.

The proof of concept, [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47995](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47995), shows that by generating the large password input, the feedback is given back as `Segmentation fault` which means that large input has tried to access to memory that should not be supposed to. Boom!

The POC in C has made public on [GitHub](https://github.com/saleemrashid/sudo-cve-2019-18634). See in action, check out THM room, [Sudo Vulns BOF](https://tryhackme.com/room/sudovulnsbof). The version 1.8.26 to 1.8.30 were reported to be exploitable. The remediation step can be done as simple as making sure to disable `pwfeedback` in `/etc/sudoers` as mentioned on [the official advisory](https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/pwfeedback/#workaround).
